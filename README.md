Includes assignments on quantization, fourier transform/signal processing/eigenfaces, ciphers

Interesting coding problems to see the applications of EE mathematics come to life!

This work falls under the Caltech honor code. Do NOT look into this repository if you are enrolling in EE 55 or courses with similar homework problems. This applies to students outside of Caltech as well!

Feel free to reach out to me with questions about the underlying math for these problems, happy to explain and chat further!
